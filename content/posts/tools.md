There are tons of developer tools out there.  On any given day, I may use dozens of different dev tools. Some are great, others not so much.  Some get in the way while others can make the life of a dev much, much easier.  Here are a few that I use regularly, in no particular order:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
  
  -  Docker is an amazing tool that really changed the face of development.  It is a system for building and running containers which are effectively whole computer systems running on your computer.  They can be used to host applications, databases, web sites, and so much more.
  
  - Docker containers save the headache of setting up identical systems on multiple developer machines, just so everyone is using the same setup. They allow you to set up a system once, and share it, or push it to the cloud and run as a server.  There is so much to say about Docker that I really can't do it justice as a bullet point.  This may need to be a full post at some point in the future.

- [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/)
  
  - VSCodium is a stripped down version of [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) which is a good tool as well, but Codium removes some silliness MS compiles into Code.
  
  - Codium (and Code) are IDE's, or Integrated Development Environments.  They bring together all that is needed to build software in a single package. IDE's are basically text editors that learned some neat tricks, like compiling code into programs, colorizing syntax, and underlining misspellings or bad code, to name a few.

- [Github](https://www.github.com)
  
  - Github is a website that hosts tons of code repos that uses [git](https://git-scm.com) as the underlying version control system.  It is huge! It hosts thousands and thousands of repos.  Some are company based, some are open source, and lots are personal repos of individual developers.

There are literally hundreds of others that I use, but this is a good start.  I'll continue adding to this list over time.
